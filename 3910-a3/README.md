How to run
-------------------
Running make will compile and execute the new converter program
The old program can be compiled with make old

Additionally, it can be ran by using ./converter after it has been compiled

Usage
-------------------
Files must have a '.' character in them for the program to recognize it as a file
There is no special option, just input the filename (Case sensitive)
and it will read through the file

Limitations
-------------------
AFAIK, the only limitation is that the Roman numerals cannot exceed 30 characters
Spaces in the text file may also cause the program to fail or give incorrect results
